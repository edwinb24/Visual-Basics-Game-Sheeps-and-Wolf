Consist of:
This program is a game for mobile devices in which the user must move platforms, and tilt them to get the nut to fall into the hands of a squirell that is waitting for it on the bottom of the screen.

Notes:
All the levels are simple copies of the 1st one, they need to be modify with moving the objects to different positions to create different layouts between levels. The game is able to save the amount of progress the player have made and the settings for the music. Design of the squirrel and the three was a contribution from my friend Kahou Mikae (for more of her work: www.facebook.com/kaho.mukae).

Tools: Corona SDK, Lua, Firefox, Windows 7

Technical:
• Designed to work on mobile devices with different screen sizes
